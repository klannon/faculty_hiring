    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of things one could take away from here:\n",
    "1. If you don't do anything special in trying to hire women, then the fraction of the women you hire will be about the same as what you see in your input population.\n",
    "1. An open search does nothing, by itself to increase diversity.\n",
    "1. Hiring women preferentially reduces the overall quality of the candidates you hire, although the effect is small if you institute a threshold for successful hiring.\n",
    "1. Performing an open search increases the quality of candidates you hire.\n",
    "1. The above two affects are just manifestations of the same general principle: searching for the best in a subset, on average, yields lower quality than searching for the best in the full set.\n",
    "1. **Performing an open search, but preferring women candidates yields *better* quality than performing a targeted search without preferring women.**  Basically, we're just canceling the two affects noted separately above.\n",
    "1. Targeted searches fail to identify a suitably high quality candidate more often than open searches.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is certainly weak points to this study.\n",
    "- My data for setting the distribution of candidates is a bit ad-hoc.  I've picked the size of the applicant pool out of thin air.\n",
    "- I have assumed that every search yields a candidate of suitable quality.  I haven't populated the candidate pool with any candidates below threshold.\n",
    "- I have assumed that when we rank candidates, we can measure their quality with no error.\n",
    "- I have assumed that we measure the quality of candidates without any bias either from gender or from the field of study.\n",
    "- I have based hiring on the current size of the group without regard for age profile or strategic goals.  For example, I havent accounted for Forro or the push to hire in material science/condensed matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle the last three, I would probably need a model of the department composition and retirement progression as well as a model of voting, including potentially individual biases of faculty per area.  If I did this, it would also let me explore different voting methodologies, so I really want to.  However, it will take some doing, so I'm going to pause here with this result."
