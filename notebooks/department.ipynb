I've only counted areas that we have in our department, and I've neglected AMO.  I'll use these numbers to sample candidates from.  The \"# of Faculty at ND\" column comes from counting up people in our department, including the 2020 retirements and also the recent HEP hire.  I'll use these numbers to set the fields in which we search (i.e. retirements proportional to group size).\n",
